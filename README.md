collaborated within a team to design and develop a web application that facilitates
non-monetary donations. I led the frontend development using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, focusing on creating an intuitive end user-friendly interface.
Additionally, I documented the complete functional and non-functional
requirements. Throughout the project, we used GitHub for version control and
collaboration.
